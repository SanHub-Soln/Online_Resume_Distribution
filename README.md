# Online_Resume_Distribution

### About This Project

This application is designed to simplify and accelerate the job application process, especially for freshers who often face the frustration of repeatedly filling out the same forms on different platforms. With our tool, users can submit their resumes and personal details once, and the system will automatically fill and submit applications to multiple companies, including those of their choice. This not only saves time but also increases the chances of getting noticed by employers quickly. Initially built to work with **Internshala** by scraping and auto-submitting applications, we plan to expand support for platforms like **LinkedIn**, **Naukri**, and more. Our goal is to empower job seekers by reducing repetitive tasks and helping them apply to their dream roles with ease.
